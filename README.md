# GameMotionControl
This project uses OpenCV to create a hand gesture control system for Forza Horizon 5. Real-time video input detects gestures and maps them to in-game actions like steering, braking, and accelerating. It offers an intuitive and immersive gaming experience using natural hand movements.
